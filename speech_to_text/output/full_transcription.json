  "full_transcript": "He's been with us for more than 15 years with the face of a dead man on his face, not a mask, but a real face. It all started after a terrible accident that left half of his face unrecognizable. Doctors said he would never speak again, would never smile again and would never be seen in public again. But he accepted something that no one had ever done before. A complete facial transplant taken from a donor. For 24 hours straight, a team of surgeons reconnected muscles, nerves and bones. At the moment of his awakening, the mirror showed a stranger, but it was him, a man with the face of another. The news shocked the world. Photographers nicknamed him the man with two lives. His name is Richard Norris Mateo. But what seemed like a miracle quickly turned into a nightmare. A few months later, his body began to reject the new face. His features slowly changed, as if the two faces were trying to merge into one. Even doctors could not explain it. They said it was a hybrid between the donor and the recipient. Matteo spent years hiding, avoiding cameras, living with an identity he no longer recognized. One day, he reappeared, smiling. He did not say a single phrase. This face is now mine. I deserve it. If you search for the story on TikTok, the man with a face transplant, you will find proof that this story is real.",
